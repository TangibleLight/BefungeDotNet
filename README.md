# BefungeDotNet

Currently a WPF User-control which provides character highlighting for a variant of Befunge-98. Supports many design-time features of the Visual Studio WPF Designer, rudimentary theming, and most data binding. 

This project was initially intended to additionally serve as a Befunge Interpreter, eventually with commands to manipulate .NET types on the Befunge stack. However the person who would have written the interpreter functionality has been unable as of yet to work on this project and had asked me to refrain from completing it for him. 

The user control is, in its current state, more of an excercise in creating a relatively complex control which exposes only the raw text of its contents. It was also a way to learn more about how the built-in controls in WPF function.
